# MachineId

## Summary

This lib was created to answer the question of how to uniquely identify a machine, VM or regular computer.
An existing library could not be found, so this was made.

This is a partial port of this [go project](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid) for uniquely identifying a machine and doing so without being an admin.

## Supported Systems

- Linux
- Windows

## Uniqueness & Stability

See the [go package docs](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid#unique-key-reliability)
